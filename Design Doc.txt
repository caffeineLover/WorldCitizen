Citizen

	A Citizen is any Citizen Candidate whose UUID and traits are written in the file census.yml.  The plugin will
	periodically search for candidates who are not currently Citizens and make them citizens.  See Events.



Events

	The plugin will use the following events to look for Citizen candidates:

		onLivingEntitySpawn
		
			When an entity spawns, check to see if it's a Citizen Candidate.  If so, make it a villager.

		onChunkLoad
		
			Iterate through all the entities of the chunk.  If there are any Citizen Candidates which are
			not already Citizens, make them into a Citizen.

		onPlayerInteract
		
			Check to see if player is interacting with a Citizen Candidate.  If so, and it's not already a
			citizen, make it into a Citizen.

		EntityDeathEvent

			When an entity dies, check to see if it's a Citizen.  If so, log the event along with the killer
			and remove the Citizen from the census.
